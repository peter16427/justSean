<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:100.36px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">also gave me a sheet of paper that listed the assignments and office duties required of me as an intern. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:114.91px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">tasks I had to complete included a couple of readings/analyses about the prevalence of climate corruption,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:158.55px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">interacting with adults. Looking back, I realize that I have learned and grew so much in terms of my</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:573.51px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">One of the first important lessons I learned from my experience as an intern was how to interact socially</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:588.06px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">with adults. Most people, I assume, overlook this skill. However, I believe that strengthening one’s ability</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:602.60px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">to socialize, whether it involves talking, eating, or other forms of common courtesy, is essential to a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:617.15px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">person's success. For example, at Transparency International, I got to have deep conversations regarding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:631.69px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">corruption with my colleagues at the office. In addition, during lunch time, I would have discussions</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:646.24px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">about topics that I find interesting and talk about my personal background. As most people, especially my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:660.79px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">age, grow and mature intellectually, mentally, and emotionally, they need to acquire such experiences with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:675.33px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">adults when they transition to the workforce in the future. Although it may seem simple, knowing how to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:71.27px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Secondly, as an intern, I believe that I greatly improved my self-discipline and ability to manage my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:85.82px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">responsibilities. Over the course of multiple weeks, I took full responsibility for waking up at 8:30 am</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:100.36px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">every day and going to the office on time. Since I’m more of a night person, waking up that early every</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:114.91px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">morning was a challenge that I had to eventually overcome. Furthermore, I made sure that I was mentally</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:129.45px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">ready and had all my daily assignments/tasks done by their respective deadlines. Because I wanted to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:202.19px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Lastly, during my internship, I had the opportunity to extend my knowledge on the topic of corruption. As</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:216.73px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">I became more aware of corruption in the various levels of our society, I decided to focus on climate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:231.28px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">corruption. Since my advisor was the executive director of climate corruption in Transparency, it was of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:245.82px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">great benefit for me to extrapolate my knowledge on such an overlooked topic. While I was thinking of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:260.37px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">the best way to learn about climate corruption, I realized that conducting an interview was the most fitting</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:71.27px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Firstly, I asked Mr. Sumalinog, a climate corruption activist, about why he joined Transparency</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:85.82px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">International. He told me that he joined because he had a desire “to understand why corruption separates</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:100.36px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">people from one another and what the reason was behind corruption causing the poor to become poorer</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:114.91px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">and the rich to become richer.” Furthermore, he continued by firmly stating that “every human being has a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:129.45px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">moral responsibility, people in high positions have a responsibility to not take advantage of any chances to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:144.00px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">become rich without using moral standards and moral integrity.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:173.09px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">My next question stemmed from my curiosity about what Transparency International was doing to tackle</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:187.64px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">climate corruption. Mr. Sumalinog explained, “We are following and monitoring climate projects that are</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:202.19px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">being funded by the climate funding institutions such as the green climate fund. We look at their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:216.73px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">transparency policies, for example, the anti corruption policy, which shows the conflict of interest policy</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:231.28px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">among the board members. Lastly, we provide inputs for the policy, we suggest policies, and we add to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:245.82px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">those transparency policies.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:274.92px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Moreover, as a teenager, I wanted to know what the youth can do to fight climate corruption. Especially in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:289.46px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">the society we live in today, governments hear out individuals who are young and passionate about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:304.01px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">eliciting change. Some examples, pointed out by Mr. Sumalinog, included “the youth collecting evidence</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:318.56px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">or data of climate corruption.” In addition, he said that “the youth can do a lot by writing to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:333.10px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">government, making suggestions or proposals of what the government can do to reduce climate pollution,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:347.65px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">and they can also do social media (take photos, upload them to Instagram). Lastly, they can participate in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:362.19px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">activities in school, or organize clubs.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:391.29px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Finally, I asked Mr. Sumalinog what issue of climate corruption he is most focused on right now.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:405.83px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Currently, he is “monitoring the green climate fund, the main funding of the United nations, to stop and to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:420.38px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">mitigate the effects of climate change globally. Many governments, public/private institutions provide</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:434.93px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">money to the green climate fund, and that money will be allocated to projects for climate in many</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:449.47px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">developing countries.” However, he states that “the money is mainly for adaptation (there are floods, so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:464.02px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">there are projects that build walls to protect vulnerable cities) and mitigation (reducing emissions of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:478.56px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">greenhouse, for example using renewable energy, solar power, wind).”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:507.66px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">Starting out as an inexperienced teenager, I have grown into a sociable, responsible, and intellectual</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:522.20px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">person that I am today. In summary, I want to emphasize that I have gained 3 important skills from this</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:536.75px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">experience: developing social interactions with adults, improving my self-discipline and ability to manage</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:551.30px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">my responsibilities, and expanding my knowledge on the topic of corruption. Therefore, as for anyone</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:565.84px" class="cls_003"><span class="cls_003">who wants to intern in the future, I strongly recommend them to make the most of it and take every</span></div>
