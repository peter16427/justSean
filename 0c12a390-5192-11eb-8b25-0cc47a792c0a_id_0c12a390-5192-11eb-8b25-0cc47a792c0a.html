<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:169.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">created Nike to become one of the most leading shoe companies in the world?</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:334.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Nike, it gave them ideas to support him, by creating a signature soccer shoe called CR7. When Nike</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:349.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">released the CR7 shoe to the public, the sales went booming and consumers were so hyped, that they</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:394.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">world. After getting so much fame, social media went viral, and Cristiano Ronaldo’s signature shoe might</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:409.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">have been the hero who influenced young soccer players who would like to be like him. Lastly, not only</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:454.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">achievements they will gain from now and the future. Thus, Cristiano Ronaldo, a great role model and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:544.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">environment and society, and they don’t hesitate to reward brands that do. For example, Nike comes into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:559.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">a fresh approach by providing customers shoes that fit today’s stylish society. Nike has been producing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:574.76px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">types of cushioning that was used in all Nike shoes depending on what the customer wanted. These three</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:108.00px;top:131.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">However, reading from many articles proved my hypothesis wrong. It turns out that Phil Knight’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:146.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">career started off lacking money and a clear direction of his future career. Having to face many struggles</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:108.00px;top:206.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Moving onto Phil Knight’s early life, he ironically used to be a runner on the track team,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:221.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">at the University of Oregon. Before becoming a prosperous man, Phil Knight had a great</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:236.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">connection to people who were involved in the running shoe industry. One day, Phil Knight</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:251.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">came into a realization that his coach of the track team, Bill Bowerman “tinkered” with athletes’</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:266.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">running shoes. During his 24 years as coach at the University of Oregon, Bowerman used to train 31</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:281.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Olympic athletes and had such a big passion for running. Both having the same interest and goals, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:296.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">turned into an agreement and wanted to have a job in the part of the athletics department. Then, the two</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:311.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">teamed up and decided to create a company selling their idea of a “perfect” running shoe.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:108.00px;top:326.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Given such an opportunity to have a big boost in his career, Phil Knight obtained the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:341.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">mindset of a “shoe dog.” It all got him started when he saw the Tiger Sneakers (now known as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:356.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Asics) being produced in Japan. Fortunately, Phil Knight got a partnership deal with the Japanese</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:371.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">company and started selling the Tiger Shoes in the U.S. After selling $8,000 in 1964, they were on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:386.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">right track to success, earning a total of 1 million worth of Tigers. But after a while, Phil Knight had to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:401.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">change the company’s foundation because there were struggles in the exclusivity agreement. He then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:416.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">changed the company’s name to Nike after the goddess Nike. This goddess was known as “one of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:431.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">most courageous and chivalrous warriors at the dawn of civilization.” Her sport-like persona caught</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:446.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Knight and Bowerman’s attention, therefore they named their company after her. Soon after the name,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:461.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Caroline Davidson created the famous “swoosh” as an emblem for Nike and was given $35 for it. After</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:476.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">releasing the business to the public, the sales rose dramatically from $10 to $270. This became the start of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:491.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">an enormous company that changed the lives of many athletes all over the world. Today, the company</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:506.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">controls a shocking 62% of the U.S brand share. This means that Nike, which leads the industry with $28</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:521.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">billion in annual sales, could see the business boom.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:551.51px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Takeaway Message:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:108.00px;top:566.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Even though Knight himself is no longer the CEO of Nike and will step down as</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:596.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">incredibly well-performing company he started. Nike nearly doubled its net income in the past</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:611.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">five years, even 35 years after going public. While it’s always a concern when a founder leaves the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:626.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">company he or she created, one last important takeaway from the memoir is that even from the beginning,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:641.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">Knight was able to find incredibly talented people to operate the company with him. The past few years</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.00px;top:656.51px" class="cls_005"><span class="cls_005">have been no exception, so Nike should be just fine even as Knight moves on.</span></div>
